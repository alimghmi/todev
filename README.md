## How to run
Simply via Docker:
```
git clone https://github.com/alimghmi/todev.git
cd todev
docke-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yaml up --build
```
Or Set it up manually:
```
git clone https://github.com/alimghmi/todev.git
cd todev/todev
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 manage.py makemigrations
python3 manage.py migrate
python3 manage.py runserver
```
### Notes: 
 - docker-compose takes care of env files automatically. Consider adding **env variables** for a better experience, in case of manual setup.
 - Please consider adding a *superuser* or create a non-super user via `signup` endpoint. 

## Authorization
Todev leverages simple-jwt. All functional endpoints of app (except login/signup) expect you to send a access token as Authorization in the header.


## Unittests
TODO


## Browsable API
It's possible to test and examine the app within browser, which is provided by DRF UI. In addition following is possible to be managed via a third party app like curl by providing the brearer token as Authorization key in the request header.


## Endpoints

## Endpoints Behavior

### Project Endpoint
- Every authenticated user can create new project
- Creator of project is considered as Project Manager
- Proejc manager has full control over the project
- Developers (members field) username must be sent on creation
- Developers have readonly access thus they can't update or remove a project
- Projects shows up when target user is either a project manager or a developer, otherwise they're not accessable
  
### Task Endpoint
- Project manager has full control over task creation and assigning them to developers
- A developer of project can add a task which will be automatically assigned to himself a.k.a developer doesn't have this right to assign other developers to a task he created
- Author of task (project manager or developer) can update or delete the task
- Assignees can update (delete not allowed) task status/name/description

## Recommended Improvements
- Endpoints to calculate developers performance
- Implementing cache system
- Custom user model to use email field as username
- Using a lint action on github
